Per-device and per-account limits
Real-time Data: 60 requests per minute
Wakes: 3 requests per minute
Device Commands: 30 requests per minute 
Authentication requests
Rate: 20 requests per second
Note: Exceeding this rate may lead to throttling or blocking. 
Shared limits
An account with multiple developer applications interacting with the same vehicle will share these rate limits. 
Error handling
If you hit a rate limit, you will receive an HTTP status code 429 Too Many Requests.
You can check the Retry-After header in the response to know when you can make the next request, or use the RateLimit--Remaining and RateLimit-*-Reset headers for more information. 
Other considerations
Streaming data: Tesla also offers a "Fleet Telemetry" method, which uses a streaming approach instead of polling. This is often the preferred method and may avoid some polling-related rate limits, as described in this Reddit thread.
Cost: Note that using the Fleet API is a paid service, though some free credits are available for personal use. Check Tesla's developer site for current pricing and details.
